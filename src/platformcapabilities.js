 Angaza SATFARM strengthens agroecological farming by combining rapid soil diagnostics with ecological decision-making. Using advanced soil measurement probes, the system analyses key parameters including pH, Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, and salinity. The data is processed instantly to generate field-specific recommendations that promote soil restoration rather than short-term input dependency.
This approach supports agroecology by guiding farmers toward balanced nutrient management, improved organic matter practices, and reduced reliance on excessive inorganic fertilisers. By identifying soil acidity, nutrient imbalances, and hidden deficiencies, SATFARM enables corrective measures such as liming, legume integration, bio-fertiliser use, and targeted supplementation.
Instead of blanket fertilisation, farmers adopt precision-based, soil-sensitive interventions that enhance natural soil processes. Over time, this strengthens soil structure, improves nutrient cycling, increases biological activity, and builds resilience against climate stress. By tracking soil conditions season after season, farmers can visibly measure improvements and sustain long-term productivity. SATFARM therefore transforms soil management into a practical agroecological tool—linking science, technology, and ecological principles to restore soil health while improving farmer livelihoods.

    full: `
Angaza SATFARM integrates IoT and Generative AI to deliver real-time crop pest and disease diagnostics directly to farmers’ smartphones. By capturing images of crop foliage, farmers trigger an AI-powered scan that analyses visual patterns associated with pests, fungal infections, nutrient-related stress, and other plant health issues. Within seconds, the system provides an accurate, data-driven diagnosis, reducing guesswork and delayed intervention.
The platform then generates clear, actionable recommendations tailored to the identified problem. Importantly, SATFARM provides two management pathways: one aligned with organic farming practices, including biological controls and integrated pest management techniques, and another aligned with conventional farming approaches, recommending appropriate pesticide or treatment options. This dual guidance ensures inclusivity, supporting farmers across different production systems.
Beyond individual farmers, agricultural extension officers also use the application to strengthen field diagnostics and advisory services. The tool enhances technical decision-making, offering evidence-based recommendations that improve accuracy and response time. By placing intelligent diagnostic capability in the hands of farmers and officers, SATFARM reduces crop losses, improves productivity, and supports more sustainable pest and disease management practices.

Angaza SATFARM extends its digital intelligence beyond crops to support comprehensive animal management... Angaza SATFARM provides farmers with access to up-to-date climate data, transforming weather information into practical, crop-specific guidance. By integrating real-time and forecasted weather data, the application helps farmers anticipate rainfall patterns, temperature changes, and potential weather shocks before they occur. This early prediction system shifts farmers from being reactive to becoming predictive and better prepared.
Farmers enter their farm location and crop planting date into the app. Using this information, SATFARM not only delivers localized weather forecasts but also generates tailored advice based on the specific crop’s growth requirements. Rather than providing general rainfall or temperature outlooks, the platform analyses whether projected conditions meet the crop’s optimal needs.
If forecasted rainfall is insufficient or excessive for the planted crop, the app advises corrective actions or recommends alternative crops better suited to expected conditions. This targeted guidance improves planting decisions, reduces climate-related risks, enhances resilience, and supports sustainable productivity in increasingly unpredictable weather environments.
